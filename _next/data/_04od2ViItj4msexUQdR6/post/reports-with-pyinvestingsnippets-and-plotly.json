Some of the changes include:\n\n* Renamed extensions to fit common financial jargon\n* Added support for dataframes\n* Added support for plotly\n* Included fantastic matplotlib and plotly [examples](https://github.com/investingsnippets/pyinvestingsnippets/tree/master/examples)\n\n<!-- [![pyinvestingsnippets + plotly = AWESOME](https://img.youtube.com/vi/IDzR-N9nfDg/0.jpg)](https://youtu.be/IDzR-N9nfDg \"pyinvestingsnippets + plotly = AWESOME\") -->\n\n<p align=\"center\"><iframe width=\"420\" height=\"315\" \nsrc=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/IDzR-N9nfDg\">\n</iframe></p>\n\n## Run the examples\n\nTo run the examples, clone [`v3.0.0`](https://github.com/investingsnippets/pyinvestingsnippets/tree/v3.0.0) and follow the `README.md` guidelines.\n\nCurrently the examples generate asset prices based on the random walk hypothesis (Brownian Motion)! This is great for a \"look and feel\" of the tool. If you want to try the examples with your own symbols then change the [ASSET_TICKERS & BENCHMARK_TICKERS](https://github.com/investingsnippets/pyinvestingsnippets/blob/v3.0.0/examples/plotly_report_dataframe.py#L25) and replace the [random price generator](https://github.com/investingsnippets/pyinvestingsnippets/blob/v3.0.0/examples/plotly_report_dataframe.py#L87) with the `yahoo` finance price [DataReader](https://github.com/investingsnippets/pyinvestingsnippets/blob/v3.0.0/examples/plotly_report_dataframe.py#L86).  \n\n## Future Plans\n\nThe journey doesn't stop here! I'm planning to extend [pyinvestingsnippets](https://pyinvestingsnippets.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) even more by introducing:\n\n* more portfolio benchmarking metrics\n* support of inflation & risk free rates\n* etc. \n\nWhat would you like so see more?

Start saving.</u>**\n   \n  > Save 10% out of the earnings from your labor. To accomplish such a stream of savings, start disfavoring the gratifications of the daily life and appreciate the accomplishment of owing substantial belongings.\n\n**<u>2. Control your expenses.</u>**\n\n  > All people are burdened with more desires than they gratify. To limit that, study thoughtfully your accustomed habits of living and prioritize your expenses while at the same time respecting each coin you earn.\n\n**<u>3. Make your savings multiply.</u>**\n\n  > While accumulating savings is gratifying, locking them down brings only loss (Inflation!). Instead, find investment opportunities! This of course increases the risk, but may also increase the reward.  \n\n**<u>4. Protect your investment from loss.</u>**\n\n  > The first principle of investment is security for your principal. The penalty of risk is probable loss. Study carefully before investing. The romantic desire to make wealth rapidly is misleading.\n\n  > Each investment is considered a type of loan where you expect to get back the principal plus a profit/loss. To ensure at least the return of the principal, make sure the \"borrower\" is able to repay and has a good reputation on that (otherwise you just making him a present).  \n\n**<u>5. Own your dwelling.</u>**\n\n  > It brings gladness to the heart when one eats from their own trees and leave in their own home. It builds confidence and will to care about the land. It also boosts the efforts behind any of the endeavors. \n\n**<u>6. Ensure a future income.</u>**\n\n  > Prepare for a suitable income in the days to come, for when you grow old. Make sure you can comfort and support your family even when you are no longer with them.   \n\n**<u>7. Increase your ability to earn.</u>**\n\n  > Cultivate your own powers, study and become wiser, become more skillful. Act as to respect yourself! Your desires must be simple and definite. They defeat their own purpose should they be too many.\n\n## The Goddess of Good Luck\n\n  > To attract good luck to yourself, it is necessary to take advantage of opportunities. Those of action on these opportunities are favored by the Goddess of Good Luck.\n\n## Lending money advices\n\n  * To borrowing and lending there is more than the passing of money from the hands of one to the hands of another.\n  * If you desire to help your friend, do so in a way that will not bring your friend's burdens to yourself.\n  * Types of loan securities/pledges:\n      * based on property. The pawn can be land, jewels etc.\n      * based on human effort. Has a steady income from labor and is trustworthy.\n      * if none of the above, can friends of the borrower guarantee that is honorable?\n  * A borrower in the throes of great emotions is not a safe risk.\n  * Ask for what purpose the borrower will use the money.\n  * Ask what knowledge the borrower has for the business they are getting into.\n  * Ask for a security in case the borrower cannot repay.\n  * Always think that your well deserved savings are yours due to the sacrifices you have made. \n\n  <center><h2><u>Better a little caution than a great regret!</u><h2></center>\n"},"nextPost":{"slug":"google-colab-and-beancount","frontmatter":{"title":"Hosting Beancount on Google Colab","description":"Access your Accounting books for free, wherever you are ;)","date":"March 26, 2022","topic":{"id":"automation","name":"Automation","image":"automation.jpg","description":"Spending time to do the same thing over and over again is tedious!

Keeping track of all that is painful and, unfortunately, there is no service yet that can connect everything together and properly present an aggregate view as well as a historical return of all the accounts together :(\n\nTo overcome this issue, I use [Beancount](https://github.com/beancount/beancount), an opensource `Double-Entry Accounting from Text Files` tool (python) that comes with several extensions and a nice web interface.\n\nAs always, I like to automate and keep my work in one place (on the cloud). I'm extensively using Google Colab and as a consequence, I had to bring all my accounting there too. :P\n\nBeancount comes with a web server (called [fava](https://github.com/beancount/fava)) and Google Colab gives you a virtual machine running your python code. That means that we can use colab to start the web server, BUT we are not allowed to access it through our public browser, UNLESS we create a tunnel! That is possible with [ngrok](https://ngrok.com/) which `exposes local servers behind NATs and firewalls to the public internet over secure tunnels` :)\n\nHere is the code I'm using...\n\n```python\n%%capture\n!pip install beancount\n!pip install fava\n!pip install pyngrok\n!pip install Jinja2 --upgrade  # Needed by fava. Restart runtime \n\nimport os\nimport logging\nfrom fava.cli import app\nfrom pyngrok import ngrok, conf\nfrom google.colab import drive\n\nNGROK_TOKEN = \"your token here\"\nLOCATION_OF_MAIN_BEANCOUNT_FILE = '/content/drive/My Drive/Colab Notebooks/beancount/base.beancount'\n\n# Mounts the google drive to the virtual machine and gives access to storage\ndrive.mount('/content/drive', force_remount=True)\n\n# disables logs for flask\nlog = logging.getLogger('werkzeug')\nlog.setLevel(logging.ERROR)\n\napp.config.from_mapping(\n    BASE_URL=\"http://localhost:5000\",\n    INCOGNITO=False,  # Set to True if you want to show your balance to someone but not reveal the actual numbers\n    USE_NGROK=os.environ.get(\"USE_NGROK\", \"True\") == \"True\" and os.environ.get(\"WERKZEUG_RUN_MAIN\") != \"true\",\n    BEANCOUNT_FILES=[\n        LOCATION_OF_MAIN_BEANCOUNT_FILE\n    ]\n)\n\nngrok.set_auth_token(NGROK_TOKEN)\nconf.get_default().monitor_thread = False\npublic_url = ngrok.connect(5000, bind_tls=True).public_url\nprint(\" * ngrok tunnel \\\"{}\\\" -> \\\"http://127.0.0.1:{}\\\"\".format(public_url, 5000))\n\napp.config[\"BASE_URL\"] = public_url\napp.run()\n```\n\nSimple, but comes with some more steps:\n\n1. Colab has an older version of Jinja2 preinstalled and when you update to latest one, you have to restart the runtime!\n2. You need an NGROK authentication token (but that is free). Register at [ngrok](https://ngrok.com/). Set the `NGROK_TOKEN` variable in the script when you are done with registering.\n3. You have to have your beancount files uploaded to google drive under `Colab Notebooks`, so they get mounted. Then you set the `LOCATION_OF_MAIN_BEANCOUNT_FILE` variable in the script.\n\nThat's it for now :) Enjoy!\n"}},"tags":[{"id":"python","name":"python","image":"python-header.png","description":"Python is very handy in investing","color":"bg-green-300","icon":"python.svg","slug":"python","count":15},{"id":"statistics","name":"statistics","image":"statistics.jpg","description":"Statistics is the discipline that concerns the collection, organization, analysis, interpretation and presentation of data. - Wikipedia","color":"bg-green-300","icon":"statistics.svg","slug":"statistics","count":4},{"id":"cryptos","name":"cryptos","image":"bitcoin.png","description":"The amazing world of Blockchain opens one more chapter in the Investing.","color":"bg-green-300","icon":"bitcoin.svg","slug":"cryptos","count":1}],"sortedTopics":[{"id":"investing","name":"Investing","image":"investing.png","description":"The piggy bank digests a good amount of the savings!
