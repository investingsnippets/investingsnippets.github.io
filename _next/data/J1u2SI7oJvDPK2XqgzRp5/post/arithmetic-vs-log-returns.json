For instance, the log return for a year is the sum of the log returns of the days within the year. Additionally, log returns are symmetric around 0 and log return values can range from minus infinity to plus infinity. Whereas, simple returnsâ€™ downside is limited at -100% and a negative movement of -25% (movement from 100$ to 75$) does not reverse the losses by going +25% (75$ to 93.75$).\n\n\nhttps://dspyt.com/simple-returns-log-return-and-volatility-simple-introduction/\n","excerpt":""},"previousPost":{"slug":"perpetuities-annuities","frontmatter":{"title":"Annuities and Perpetuities","description":"How a credit installment is repaid?
