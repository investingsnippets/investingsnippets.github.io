They fail to answer questions like:\n\n* How close are the values to each other?\n* What is the largest difference between the values?\n* On average, how far are the values from each other?\n\nMeasures of variability (also called spread) fill this gap. The most common are:\n\n* Standard Deviation (SD)\n* Range, which is the largest value minus the smallest value\n* Interquartile Range (IQR) which is the upper quartile (75th percentile), minus the lower quartile (25th percentile)\n\nIn investing, Standard Deviation is one of the most common methods for determining the risk of an investment (also called `volatility`).\n\n## Variance ($Var$ or $\\sigma^2$) & Standard Deviation ($\\sigma$)\n\nVariance is the average squared difference from the mean, or alternatively, how spread out the data are around their mean.  \n\n$$\nVar(x) = \\sigma^2 = \\sigma_x^2 = \\frac{\\sum_{i=1}^{n}(x_i - \\bar{x})^2}{n-1}\n$$\n\n> **Note**: We can divide by n or n-1. n is the total population of an event. n-1 a series of it. numpy is, by default, using n-1! The difference is negligible for long sequences, but not for short ones!\n\nWe see above that, for some reason, we squared the difference ($(x_i - \\bar{x})^2$), instead of just taking the absolute difference ($x_i - \\bar{x}$). We did that in order to avoid the [same problem](/post/measures-of-location) we have with the mean, where the sum can be zero because of negative values in the list. Imagine, for example, having the sequence `-10,1,2,3,4`. What is the mean value? 0! And, how spread are the data around the mean? 0 again. It doesn't really make much sense, right? By observing the sequence, we see that there is some spreading of the data around \"something\". This, \"something\" doesn't feel to be 0. It feels like something close to the `1,2,3,4` values, which look like a group of values that are really close to each other. I know that is kinda difficult to grasp. But, not until we raise it to another \"dimension\" :). And that is what we do when we square the values.\n\n* we remove the negative sign\n* we make the values that are far from \"the group\", to stand out (the outliers are emphasized).\n* we change the unit of measurement (it is now something much bigger). Like another dimension!\n\nTo return back to the unit we started with, but meanwhile keep the notion of spreading, we use the RMS ([Root Mean Square](/post/measures-of-location)) of all the distances to the mean. We call that Standard Deviation (SD): \n\n$$\n\\sigma_x = \\sqrt{Var(x)}\n$$\n\n\n### Standard Deviation in Investing\n\nStandard Deviation measures the volatility of an asset. Large values mean that the asset's price can diverge a lot from the mean value. Thus, an indication of higher risk. On the flip side, low volatility may indicate low risk. \n\n> A critical point to remember is that standard Deviation is a backward looking tool and not a guarantee of future moves.\n\nWhile daily returns (usually log returns) of an asset are more like leptokurtotic distributions (i.e. exhibit fat tails), we can add some abstraction by saying that are normally distributed (not to measure actual risk, but to get an initial approximation of risk). \n\nNormal distributions have some very unique attributes. The most important are:\n\n* The center of a normal distribution is located at its peak, and 50% of the data lies above the mean, while 50% lies below. The mean, median, and mode are all equal\n* Approximately 68% of the data lies within 1 SD of the mean, Approximately 95% of the data lies within 2 SD of the mean, Approximately 99.7% of the data lies within 3 SD of the mean. This is known as `The empirical rule`.\n\n![png](measures-of-variability-normal-distribution.png)\n\nLet's assume that the average price of an asset is 40\\$ (measured with daily returns for some period) and the standard deviation is 5\\$. We can assume with 95% certainty the next closing price remains between 30\\$ and 50\\$! (More on that in a later post). In other words, we are 95% sure that the max loss will not exceed 10\\$.\n\n> Standard Deviation is considered a pure measure of risk (due to returns distribution deviate from the normal one), but is a good indicator of how volatile as asset is. \n\n## Percentiles\n\nWe find the percentile by ordering all the values in a dataset from smallest to largest. Then we multiply the number of values by the percentile we want. This, will give us the index of this percentile in the dataset. The value at this index is the requested percentile.\n\nFor example, suppose you have 12 daily stock return, ordered from lowest to highest: `2.3, 2.7, 3.1, 3.5, 3.9, 4.6, 4.7, 5, 5.1, 5.2, 5.4, 9`. To find the 90th percentile for these (ordered) returns, start by multiplying 90% times the size of the dataset, which gives 90% * 12 = 0.90 * 12 = 10.8 (the index). Rounding up to the nearest whole number, you get 11.\n\nCounting from left to right (from the smallest to the largest value in the dataset), you go until you find the 11th value in the dataset. That value is 5.4, and it’s the 90th percentile for this dataset.\n\nSomeone can think of the percentile as a lower dimension of the quantile. And the quartile a lower dimension of the percentile. This, because a quantile (which spans to any type of quantity) can take any upper value (like ex. 1500). The percentile (cent=100) is bound between 0-100. And the quartile (quarter) bound between 1-4. \n\nThus:\n\n* The 25th percentile is also called the first quartile.\n* The 50th percentile is generally the median.\n* The 75th percentile is also called the third quartile.\n* The difference between the third and first quartiles is the interquartile range.\n\n### Percentiles in Investing\n\nA simple example of how percentiles can be used in Investing was introduced in the previous section, where we asked, how sure we were that a loss will not exceed a value. Questions like that can be asked in numerous ways, and in the majority of the cases involve some sort of percentile representation.","excerpt":""},"previousPost":{"slug":"measures-of-location","frontmatter":{"title":"Measures of Location","description":"Use average, median, mode and more, to understand basic investing.","date":"October 18, 2020","tags":[{"id":"python","name":"python","image":"python-header.png","description":"Python is very handy in investing","color":"bg-green-300","icon":"python.svg"},{"id":"statistics","name":"statistics","image":"statistics.jpg","description":"Statistics is the discipline that concerns the collection, organization, analysis, interpretation and presentation of data. - Wikipedia","color":"bg-green-300","icon":"statistics.svg"}],"topic":{"id":"mathematics","name":"Mathematics","image":"mathematics.png","description":"Investing, as part of the Science of Finance, is subject to the lows of Mathematics!","color":"bg-green-300"},"author":{"id":"chris","name":"Chris","image":"https://s.gravatar.com/avatar/db809ecfa64d56da4bd9704c8393005a?s=80","description":"Software Engineer, passionate about ..."},"img":"https://www.picpedia.org/highway-signs/images/average.jpg"},"excerpt":"","content":"\nIn investing, we are often presented with the challenge to analyze a data set (with historical prices of stocks, funds, etc.). \n\nWe are asked to answer questions like:\n\n* What is the average return of a stock the last x days (given the daily returns)?\n* What is the return of a stock that occurred the most the last x days?\n* etc. \n\nTo answer, we commonly start by exploring some attributes that best describe the data. We often call them [`Measures of Location`](https://www.encyclopedia.com/computing/dictionaries-thesauruses-pictures-and-press-releases/measures-location).\n\nThe most common measures of location are the Mean, Median and Mode.\n\n### Mean (or **Average**, or **Expected Value**) and Root Mean Square (RMS)\n\nMean is the sum of the values of the data points divided by the number of data points. That is,\n\n$$ \n\\bar{Y} = \\frac {\\sum_{i=1}^N Y_{i}}{N},\n$$\n\nBut, what if we have a sequence like `0\t4\t1\t-4\t-1`? The Mean will be 0! In that case we reside to the RMS which is \n\n$$\n\\bar{Y}_{rms} = \\sqrt \\frac {\\sum_{i=1}^N Y_{i}^2}{N},\n$$\n\n### Median\n\nIs the value of the point which has half the data smaller than that point and half the data larger than that point.\n\n$$\n\\tilde{Y} = Y_{\\frac {N+1}{2}}, \\text{if } N = odd\n$$\n\n$$\n\\tilde{Y} = \\frac {Y_{\\frac {N}{2}} + Y_{\\frac {N}{2} + 1}}{2}, \\text{if } N = even\n$$\n\n### Mode\n\nIs the value of the random sample that occurs with the greatest frequency (might not be unique).\n\n## Example\n\nLet us generate some random data to showcase the above. We use `random.normal` here, which generates normally distributed numbers (we will discuss about normality in a following article) between -10 and 10. In terms of Investing, think of it as the simple returns (return = the percentage change of the today's closing price, over the yesterday's closing price) of a stock over a period.\n\n<details><summary>Package Installation</summary>\n<p>\n\n```python\nimport pandas as pd\nimport numpy as np\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nimport seaborn as sns\nsns.set() \n```\n\n</p>\n</details>\n\n```python\nrandomInts = np.random.normal(loc=10, scale=3, size=1000).astype(int)-10\n\ndf = pd.DataFrame(randomInts, columns=['Returns'])\ndf.plot();\n```\n   \n![png](measures-of-location/measures-of-location_3_0.png)\n\n### Mean\n\n```python\ndf.Returns.sum()/df.Returns.size\n```\n    -0.612\n\n```python\n# or\nmean = df.Returns.mean()\nmean\n```\n    -0.612\n\nWhich is the answer to: `What is the average return of a stock the last x days?`\n\n### Median\n\n```python\nnp.sort(df.Returns.values)[int(df.Returns.size/2)]\n```\n    -1\n\n```python\n# or\nmedian = np.percentile(df.Returns,50)\nmedian\n```\n    -1.0\n\n### Mode\n\n```python\nsample_data = [1,2,3,4,3,5,3,6,3,7,8,9]\nsample_data_df = pd.DataFrame(sample_data, columns=['Returns'])\nsample_data_df.Returns.mode()[0]\n```\n    3\n\nIt is apparent from the above that the number with the most frequent appearance is the number 3. That is because the numbers are discrete.\n\nBut, in a sequence of data that is continuous, the numbers can take any value in a range, which means decimal part (fractions). In cases like that it is difficult to find a single number that is present more often in the set. And that is normally the case in investing (the returns can take any value). Thus, we have to follow another approach and that is to separate the data into buckets. Here is where the notion of the [histogram](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Histogram) comes into play and generates an outcome like:\n\n\n```python\ndf.plot.hist(bins=50, figsize=(12,6), grid=True);\n```\n    \n![png](measures-of-location/measures-of-location_14_0.png)\n\nWhat really happens is to order the values in ascending order and then separate them in a number of buckets. For example if the min value is 1 and the max 10 and we split them in 9 buckets, the first one will include all numbers from 1 to 2, the second all numbers from 2 to 3 and so on. The next step is to find the bucket with the highest amount of elements and take the middle value.  \n\n```python\ncounts, bins = np.histogram(df.Returns, bins=50)\nmax_index_col = np.argmax(counts, axis=0)\nmode = bins[max_index_col]\nmode\n```\n    -1.0\n\n```python\n# or\ndf.Returns.mode()[0]\n```\n    -1\n\n\n## Alternative Measures of Location\n\nIn addition to the more common measures, there are several more that can also be included to the investing algorithms. \n\n* Mid-Mean - computes a mean using the data between the 25th and 75th percentiles.\n* Trimmed Mean - similar to the mid-mean except different percentile values are used. A common choice is to trim 5% of the points in both the lower and upper tails, i.e., calculate the mean for data between the 5th and 95th percentiles.\n* Winsorized Mean - similar to the trimmed mean. However, instead of trimming the points, they are set to the lowest (or highest) value. For example, all data below the 5th percentile are set equal to the value of the 5th percentile and all data greater than the 95th percentile are set equal to the 95th percentile.\n* Mid-range = (largest + smallest)/2.\n\n### Mid-Mean\n\n```python\n# p_25 = df.Returns.quantile(0.25)  # Much slower than np.percentile\np_25 = np.percentile(df.Returns,25) # attention : the percentile is given in percent (5 = 5%)\np_75 = np.percentile(df.Returns,75)\nmid_mean = df[df.Returns.gt(p_25) & df.Returns.lt(p_75)].Returns.mean()\nmid_mean\n```\n    -1.010498687664042\n\n### Trimmed-Mean\n\n```python\np_5 = np.percentile(df.Returns,5)\np_95 = np.percentile(df.Returns,95)\ntrimmed_mean = df[df.Returns.gt(p_5) & df.Returns.lt(p_95)].Returns.mean()\ntrimmed_mean\n```\n    -0.5480427046263345\n\n### Winsorized Mean\n\n```python\ndata_indexes_to_stay_same = ( df.Returns > p_5 ) & ( df.Returns < p_95 )\ndata_to_stay_same = df[data_indexes_to_stay_same]\nall_data_bellow_p_5 = df[df.Returns <= p_5].copy()\nall_data_bellow_p_5.Returns.values[:] = p_5\nall_data_above_p_95 = df[df.Returns >= p_95].copy()\nall_data_above_p_95.Returns.values[:] = p_95\nwinsored_rets_list = [all_data_bellow_p_5, data_to_stay_same, all_data_above_p_95]\nwinsored_rets = pd.concat(winsored_rets_list)\nwinsored_mean = winsored_rets.Returns.mean()\nwinsored_mean\n```\n    -0.608\n\n### Mid-range\n\n```python\nmid_range = (df.Returns.max() + df.Returns.min())/2\nmid_range\n```\n    -1.0\n\n#### All Together\n\n```python\n# df.Returns.plot.hist(bins=200, figsize=(15,6), grid=True)\nplt.figure(figsize=(15,6))\nsns.histplot(df.Returns, kde=True, bins=100)\nplt.title(\"Measures of Location\")\nplt.xlabel(\"Utv\", labelpad=20, weight='bold', size=12)\nplt.ylabel(\"# of Utv in a bin\", labelpad=20, weight='bold', size=12)\nplt.axvline(x=mid_range, label='mid_range={:.3f}'.format(mid_range), ymax=0.95, c=np.random.rand(3,))\nplt.axvline(x=mean, label='mean={:.3f}'.format(mean), ymax=0.95, c=np.random.rand(3,))\nplt.axvline(x=median, label='median={:.3f}'.format(median), ymax=0.95, c=np.random.rand(3,))\nplt.axvline(x=mode, label='mode={:.3f}'.format(mode), ymax=0.95, c=np.random.rand(3,))\nplt.axvline(x=mid_mean, label='mid_mean={:.3f}'.format(mid_mean), ymax=0.95, c=np.random.rand(3,))\nplt.axvline(x=winsored_mean, label='winsored_mean={:.3f}'.format(winsored_mean), ymax=0.95, c=np.random.rand(3,))\nplt.axvline(x=trimmed_mean, label='trimmed_mean={:.3f}'.format(trimmed_mean), ymax=0.95, c=np.random.rand(3,))\nplt.gca().legend(loc=\"upper left\")\nplt.show()\n```\n\n![png](measures-of-location/measures-of-location_28_0.png)\n"},"nextPost":{"slug":"geometric-progression-and-compounding-of-returns","frontmatter":{"title":"Geometric Progression and the Compounding of the Returns","description":"Your savings account offers a 1% annual interest!

An investment yield an average annual return R of 2% for the last 5 years. If we had invested 100\\$ 5 years ago, what would be the outcome of this investment today?\n\nConsider an initial investment amount $P_0 = 100$. After the first year, the outcome would be:\n\n$$\nP_1 = 100 + (100 * 0.02) = (100 * 1) + (100 * 0.02) = 100 * (1 + 0.02) = P_0 * 1.02\n$$\n\nThe outcome after the 2nd year would be:\n\n$$\nP_2 = P_1 + (P_1 * 0.02) = P_1 * 1.02\n$$\n\n3rd year:\n\n$$\nP_3 = P_2 + (P_2 * 0.02) = P_2 * 1.02\n$$\n\n(ν-1)th year:\n\n$$\nP_{ν-1} = P_{ν-2} + (P_{ν-2} * 0.02) = P_{ν-2} * 1.02\n$$\n\nνth year:\n\n$$\nP_ν = P_{ν-1} + (P_{ν-1} * 0.02) = P_{ν-1} * 1.02\n$$\n\nIt becomes obvious from the above that generating each element in the sequence $P_0, P_1, ..., P_{ν-1}, P_ν$ follows a pattern where each occurrence is generated by multiplying the previous number with a constant.\n\nIn our case, the constant is the average annual return plus 1 (1+R). If we combine the previous equations in an attempt to formulate a final equation that provides the νth occurrence based on the $P_0$ element then:\n\n$$\nP_ν = P_{ν-1} * 1.02 = (P_{ν-2} * 1.02) * 1.02 = P_{ν-2} * 1.02^2 = .... = P_0 * (1 + 0.02)^ν\n$$\n\nSo, after 5 years we will have $100 * 1.02^{5} = 110.41$!\n\nThe generic equation is:\n\n$$\nP_ν = P_0 * (1 + R)^ν \\qquad (1)\n$$\n\n## Geometric Progression\n\nIn calculus, a sequence of numbers where each term after the first is found by multiplying the previous one by a fixed, non-one number, called `geometric progression`. The fixed number is called, the `common ratio`.\n\n$$\na, ar, ar^2, ... , ar^{n-1}\n$$\n\nwhere $1+R$ is the `common ratio` and $a$ is the `coefficient`.\n\nSome interesting properties to notice:\n\n* a common ratio greater than 1, will produce exponential growth towards positive infinity!\n* a common ratio greater than 0 and up to 1, will produce exponential decay towards zero!\n\nIn finance, the periodic reinvestment on a rate is called **Compounding of Returns**.\n\n## From cumulative to periodic returns\n\nLet's see the example above from another angle. Let's say that an investment had a total return over the last 5 years of 10%. What was the average annual return of this investment?\n\nThe cumulative return (`pandas.pct_change`) is given by the type:\n\n$$\nR_i = \\frac{P_i-P_{i-1}}{P_{i-1}} = \\frac{P_i}{P_{i-1}} - 1 \\qquad (2)\n$$\n\nwhere $P_i$ is the price of the investment at period $i$.\n\nThe equation (2) can be written as $P_i = P_{i-1} * (1 + R_i)$. Or $P_{end-of-investment} = P_{start-of-investment} * (1 + R_{total})$.\n\nThe equation (1) will take the form,\n\n$$\nP_{end-of-investment} = P_{start-of-investment} * (1 + R_{annual})^{5}\n$$\n\nCombining them,\n\n$$\n1 + R_{total} = (1 + R_{annual})^{5} => R_{annual} = \\sqrt[5]{1+R_{total}} - 1\n$$\n\nWe use ν = 5, due to 5 compounding periods. If instead of annual returns we were asked to find semiannual returns then we would use ν = 10 ($R_{semiannual} = \\sqrt[10]{1+R_{total}} - 1$).\n\nFinally,\n\n$$\nR_{annual} = \\sqrt[5]{1 + 0.1} - 1 = \\sqrt[5]{1.1} - 1 = 1.01927 - 1 = 0.01927\n$$ \n\nSo, an annual return of 1.9% will produce a 10% return at the end of the 5 years.\n\nTo generalize\n\n$$\nR_{periodic} = \\sqrt[number-of-periods]{1+R_{total}} - 1 \\qquad (3)\n$$\n\n## Compounding variable returns\n\nIt is commonly accepted that returns do not stay the same over periods. For example, the average return of this month is not the same as the one from last month! However, the same principle of compounding applies in this case too. Let's see an example.\n\nAn investment yield the following returns for the past couple of months $0.021, 0.032, -0.018, 0.06, -0.043, 0.048$. The total return is the **product** of the individual returns when 1 is added to them:\n\n$$\nR = (1 + 0.021) * (1 + 0.032) * (1 - 0.018) * (1 + 0.06) * (1 - 0.043) * (1 + 0.048) = ...\n$$\n\nThis, resonates with the equation (1) above where for a fixed return we have $R_{total} = (1 + R_{fixed})^{number-of-periods}$\n"}},"tags":[{"id":"python","name":"python","image":"python-header.png","description":"Python is very handy in investing","color":"bg-green-300","icon":"python.svg","slug":"python","count":16},{"id":"statistics","name":"statistics","image":"statistics.jpg","description":"Statistics is the discipline that concerns the collection, organization, analysis, interpretation and presentation of data. - Wikipedia","color":"bg-green-300","icon":"statistics.svg","slug":"statistics","count":4},{"id":"cryptos","name":"cryptos","image":"bitcoin.png","description":"The amazing world of Blockchain opens one more chapter in the Investing.","color":"bg-green-300","icon":"bitcoin.svg","slug":"cryptos","count":1}],"sortedTopics":[{"id":"investing","name":"Investing","image":"investing.png","description":"The piggy bank digests a good amount of the savings!
