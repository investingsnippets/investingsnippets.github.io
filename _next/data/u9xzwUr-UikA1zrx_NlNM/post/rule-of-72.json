For instance, the log return for a year is the sum of the log returns of the days within the year. Additionally, log returns are symmetric around 0 and log return values can range from minus infinity to plus infinity. Whereas, simple returnsâ€™ downside is limited at -100% and a negative movement of -25% (movement from 100$ to 75$) does not reverse the losses by going +25% (75$ to 93.75$).\n\n\nhttps://dspyt.com/simple-returns-log-return-and-volatility-simple-introduction/\n"},"nextPost":{"slug":"pension-planning-lite","frontmatter":{"title":"Pension Planning - Lite","description":"Understand how to account for your pension.","date":"January 8, 2023","topic":{"id":"investing","name":"Investing","image":"investing.png","description":"The piggy bank digests a good amount of the savings!
