The idea of the `wealth index` is very powerful because it represents the cumulative profit of an asset (since it depends on the price returns).\n\nNow, if we have invested 100$ on an asset and we were asked to find the maximum loss, when did that happen and for how long did it last? We need to walk through our wealth index and find all the deeps, then see which one was the largest, when it did happen and when it finally recovered to the previous peak value.\n\nWe employ a well known measure of risk in Investing, called **Drawdown**.\n\n## Computation and Plotting of the Drawdown\n\nFirst the ground code that allows us to fetch stock historical data.\n\n```\n%pip install yahoofinancials\nfrom yahoofinancials import YahooFinancials\nimport pandas as pd\nimport matplotlib\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nimport seaborn as sns\nimport dateutil.parser\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef retrieve_stock_data(ticker, start, end):\n    json = YahooFinancials(ticker).get_historical_price_data(start, end, \"daily\")\n    columns=[\"adjclose\"]  # [\"open\",\"close\",\"adjclose\"]\n    df = pd.DataFrame(columns=columns)\n    for row in json[ticker][\"prices\"]:\n        d = dateutil.parser.isoparse(row[\"formatted_date\"])\n        df.loc[d] = [row[\"adjclose\"]] # [row[\"open\"], row[\"close\"], row[\"adjclose\"]]\n    df.index.name = \"date\"\n    df.columns = [ticker]\n    return df\n\ndef normal_rets(S):\n    return S.pct_change().dropna()\n```\n\nI'll randomly pick Apple's (AAPL) stock for this analysis.\n\n```\napple_stock_prices = retrieve_stock_data(\"AAPL\", \"1990-03-14\", \"2021-02-17\")\napple_rets = normal_rets(apple_stock_prices).dropna()\nfig, (ax1, ax2) = plt.subplots(2, sharex=True, figsize=(14,7))\nfig.suptitle(\"Apple's Price & Returns\")\napple_stock_prices.plot(ax=ax1, label='Price')\napple_rets.plot(ax=ax2, label='Returns')\nplt.legend(loc=\"upper left\")\nplt.show()\n```\n\n![png](drawdown/drawdown_3_0.png)\n\nSay now that we invested 100$ late 2016. Let's build the wealth index like we did in this [post](/post/from-portfolio-wealth-index-to-index-fund), and find the peaks of the wealth index. That is, the highest generated wealth prices before a deep.\n\n```\nwealth_index = 100*(1+apple_rets.AAPL[\"12-2016\":]).cumprod()\npeaks = wealth_index.cummax()\nax = wealth_index.plot(figsize=(14,7), label=\"W-Index\")\npeaks.plot(ax=ax, label=\"Peaks\")\nplt.legend(loc=\"upper left\")\nplt.show()\n```\n \n![png](drawdown/drawdown_5_0.png)\n\nDo you see these nice lagoons? Well, we wouldn't want them to be deep and long in duration, cause that is when our investment looses value and we have to wait until it recovers!\n\nSo, moving forward we want to find which lagoon was the deepest, how deep? and how long did it take to move back to the previous peak.\n\nFirst things first, we have to measure at any given point what is the difference between the peak and the wealth index. For example, the peak at a given point is 220\\$ and the index is 150\\$. That means that the index is 70\\$ below the peak. Since our target point is 220\\$ and we have lost 70\\$, we can say that we we are $-\\frac{70}{220}=31.8$% below the target.\n\n```\ndrawdown =  (wealth_index - peaks)/peaks\ndrawdown.plot(figsize=(14,7), title=\"Drawdown\")\n```\n\n![png](drawdown/drawdown_7_1.png)\n\nThe diagram above is what we call a **Drawdown** of an asset and it doesn't really have to do with any initial investment. Drawdown is a very nice indicator of risk since it is more realistic when compared to other risk indicators that involve standard deviations (Since returns deviate from normality as we proved in [Are Stock Returns Normally Distributed](/post/are-stock-returns-normally-distributed))\n\n## Useful insights from the Drawdown\n\nWe are now ready to find the largest drawdown and the date that occurred. \n\n```\ndrawdown.min(), drawdown.idxmin()\n```\n    (-0.38515910000506054, Timestamp('2019-01-03 00:00:00'))\n\nWe see that on the 3rd of January 2019 our investment was loosing 38.5% of its value!\n\nOne step further, we will try to find how long the lagoons lasted and find the longest one and an average of their durations.\n\n```\ndef compute_drawdown_lagoons_durations(drawdown):\n  # find all the locations where the drawdown == 0\n  zero_locations = np.unique(np.r_[(drawdown == 0).values.nonzero()[0], len(drawdown) - 1])\n  # also assign the dates so we know when things were not sinking\n  zero_locations_series = pd.Series(zero_locations, index=drawdown.index[zero_locations])\n  # do a shift to show what is the last and previous non zero dates\n  df = zero_locations_series.to_frame('zero_loc')\n  df['prev_zloc'] = zero_locations_series.shift()\n  # keep only the dates where the difference is more than 1\n  # that denotes the lagoons\n  df = df[df['zero_loc'] - df['prev_zloc'] > 1].astype(int)\n  df['duration'] = df['zero_loc'].map(drawdown.index.__getitem__) - df['prev_zloc'].map(drawdown.index.__getitem__)\n  df = df.reindex(drawdown.index)\n  df = df.dropna()\n  return df['duration']\n```\n\n```\ndf = compute_drawdown_lagoons_durations(drawdown)\ndf\n```\n\n    date\n    2016-12-06     4 days\n    2016-12-13     4 days\n    2016-12-27     6 days\n    2017-01-06    10 days\n    2017-01-17     6 days\n                   ...   \n    2020-08-26     2 days\n    2020-08-31     5 days\n    2020-12-28   118 days\n    2021-01-21    24 days\n    2021-02-16    21 days\n    Name: duration, Length: 69, dtype: timedelta64[ns]\n\nThe DataFrame above prints the last day of a drawdown, and its duration in days.\n\n```\ndf.max(), df.mean()\n```\n\n    (Timedelta('372 days 00:00:00'), Timedelta('20 days 02:46:57.391304347'))\n\nThe longest drawdown lasted 372 days! and the average duration of a drawdown was 20 days :)\n\nStay tuned!\n","excerpt":""},"previousPost":{"slug":"from-portfolio-wealth-index-to-index-fund","frontmatter":{"title":"From Portfolio Wealth Index to Index Funds","description":"Ever wandered how an index fund is built?

Since we invested only 100\\$ and not ~140$ (the price of one stock at the moment).\n* The wealth index cares about the daily returns and not the actual price of the asset.\n\nThis last bullet allows us to extend the previous scenario by including more assets in our investment without taking into account the prices of the assets, but only the returns.\n\n## Portfolio Cumulative Wealth Index\n\nI will simplify how a primitive index fund (or Mutual Fund or an ETF) is built by extending the process from the previous section.\n\nSay now that, instead of investing 100$ to MSFT, we split the amount into 4 equal parts and we buy 4 different stocks.

However, even simplistic, this is how a traded fund looks like.\n\nIn practice, a fund is a bucket of assets weighted in a structured way, and initialized with a price (like i did above with the 100$). Then, they are offered in the stock exchange for purchasing. In our example above, if it was a traded fund, the investors would deposit money to the fund and the fund would buy the underlying assets based on the specified weights. The buying and selling of the fund, doesn't affect the price of the fund directly (but indirectly through the underlying assets).\n\nThe difference among the different types of funds is due to the way weights are calculated. Mutual and ETFs have managers that pick these weights based on market research, and other characteristics. The managers, can change the weights by performing a rebalancing of the portfolio.\n\nIn index funds (also known as passive ETFs) the weights are usually based on market cap and maybe other attributes and require minimum intervention from a manager (and due to that are normally much cheaper than the other types of funds). In the simplest case, an index fund could follow all the assets of a specific industry and allocate the weights according to the market capitalization of each asset (divided by the total market cap of all the assets in the index) or just follow the same weighting strategy of a well known index, such as S&P 500.\n\nIn future posts, I will try to build (and invent) different types of funds.\n\nUntil next time!\n"},"nextPost":null},"tags":[{"id":"python","name":"python","image":"python-header.png","description":"Python is very handy in investing","color":"bg-green-300","icon":"python.svg","slug":"python","count":7},{"id":"statistics","name":"statistics","image":"statistics.jpg","description":"Statistics is the discipline that concerns the collection, organization, analysis, interpretation and presentation of data. - Wikipedia","color":"bg-green-300","icon":"statistics.svg","slug":"statistics","count":4}],"sortedTopics":[{"id":"investing","name":"Investing","image":"investing.png","description":"The piggy bank digests a good amount of the savings!
