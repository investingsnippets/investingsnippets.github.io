## The 7 steps to build wealth

**<u>1. Start saving.</u>**
   
  > Save 10% out of the earnings from your labor. To accomplish such a stream of savings, start disfavoring the gratifications of the daily life and appreciate the accomplishment of owing substantial belongings.

**<u>2. Control your expenses.</u>**

  > All people are burdened with more desires than they gratify. To limit that, study thoughtfully your accustomed habits of living and prioritize your expenses while at the same time respecting each coin you earn.

**<u>3. Make your savings multiply.</u>**

  > While accumulating savings is gratifying, locking them down brings only loss (Inflation!). Instead, find investment opportunities! This of course increases the risk, but may also increase the reward.  

**<u>4. Protect your investment from loss.</u>**

  > The first principle of investment is security for your principal. The penalty of risk is probable loss. Study carefully before investing. The romantic desire to make wealth rapidly is misleading.

  > Each investment is considered a type of loan where you expect to get back the principal plus a profit/loss. To ensure at least the return of the principal, make sure the "borrower" is able to repay and has a good reputation on that (otherwise you just making him a present).  

**<u>5. Own your dwelling.</u>**

  > It brings gladness to the heart when one eats from their own trees and leave in their own home. It builds confidence and will to care about the land. It also boosts the efforts behind any of the endeavors. 

**<u>6. Ensure a future income.</u>**

  > Prepare for a suitable income in the days to come, for when you grow old. Make sure you can comfort and support your family even when you are no longer with them.   

**<u>7. Increase your ability to earn.</u>**

  > Cultivate your own powers, study and become wiser, become more skillful. Act as to respect yourself! Your desires must be simple and definite. They defeat their own purpose should they be too many.
