It has been some time now that I was looking around the net for a pension calculator that is intuitive and will help me understand
what how things work and how I can plan based on my current situation.

While there is a plethora of tools, videos and blog posts, I was not able to find something that will guide me step by step
in an easy way

So, I decided to create something from scratch and make it available :satisfied:!


You can find a simple, lightweight and intuitive pension planner in this [link](https://pension-calculator-lite.streamlit.app/).

I hope you enjoy it!
